function name: asmSwap(inpAddr,signed,elementSize)
function description:
    Checks magnitude of each of two input values 
    v1 and v2 that are stored in adjacent in 32bit memory words.
    v1 is located in memory location (inpAddr)
    v2 is located at mem location (inpAddr + M4 word dize)
    
    If v1 or v2 is 0, this function immediately
    places 0 in r0 and returns to the caller.
    
    Else, if v1 <= v2, this function 
    does not modify memory, and returns 0 in r0. 

    Else, if v1 > v2, this function 
    swaps the values and returns 1 in r0

Inputs: r0: inpAddr: Address of v1 to be examined. 
	             Address of v2 is: inpAddr + M4 word size
	r1: signed: 1 indicates values are signed, 
	            0 indicates values are unsigned
	r2: size: number of bytes for each input value.
                  Valid values: 1, 2, 4
                  The values v1 and v2 are stored in
                  the least significant bits at locations
                  inpAddr and (inpAddr + M4 word size).
                  Any bits not used in the word may be
                  set to random values. They should be ignored
                  and must not be modified.
Outputs: r0 returns: -1 If either v1 or v2 is 0
                      0 If neither v1 or v2 is 0, 
                        and a swap WAS NOT made
                      1 If neither v1 or v2 is 0, 
                        and a swap WAS made             
             
         Memory: if v1>v2:
			swap v1 and v2.
                 Else, if v1 == 0 OR v2 == 0 OR if v1 <= v2:
			DO NOT swap values in memory.

NOTE: definitions: "greater than" means most positive number

function name: asmSort(startAddr,signed,elementSize)
function description:
    Sorts value in an array from lowest to highest.
    The end of the input array is marked by a value
    of 0.
    The values are sorted "in-place" (i.e. upon returning
    to the caller, the first element of the sorted array 
    is located at the original startAddr)
    The function returns the total number of swaps that were
    required to put the array in order in r0. 
    
         
Inputs: r0: startAddr: address of first value in array.
		      Next element will be located at:
                          inpAddr + M4 word size
	r1: signed: 1 indicates values are signed, 
	            0 indicates values are unsigned
	r2: elementSize: number of bytes for each input value.
                          Valid values: 1, 2, 4
Outputs: r0: number of swaps required to sort the array
         Memory: The original input values will be
                 sorted and stored in memory starting
		 at mem location startAddr
